This assignment was from the Rutgers Introduction to Artificial Intellligence where a player tries to reach a target in a gridworld maze. This program follows the structure 
of search problem formulation and analyzes each path of different algorithms. The main algorithm used is A Star, but the assignment focuses on different variations of this algorithm 
(Repeated Forward A*, Repeated Backward A*, and Adaptive A*). 

The report provides information about the program and is based off of questions that were given for the assignment (Will not be providing the questions because concerns about the 
visibility of the repository).
